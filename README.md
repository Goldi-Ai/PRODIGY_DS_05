# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis

This project is part of **Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship (Task-05)**.  
The aim is to analyze the **US Accidents Dataset** to uncover patterns, identify accident-prone locations, and understand factors like **time, weather, and road conditions** that affect accidents.  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** US Accidents (2016 – 2023)  
- **Source:** [Kaggle US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)  
- **Size:** ~7.7M records  
- **Features:** Location, Start Time, Weather, Severity, etc.  

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goldi-Ai/Traffic-Accident-Analysis.git
cd Traffic-Accident-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/accident_analysis.ipynb
```

Outputs generated:  
- 📈 Plots (`outputs/plots/`)  
- 🗺️ Interactive Accident Hotspot Map (`outputs/plots/accident_hotspots.html`)

## 📌 Analysis & Visualizations

1. **Accidents by Hour of Day** – Peak during morning and evening rush hours.  
2. **Accidents by Day of Week** – Higher on weekdays than weekends.  
3. **Accidents by Month** – More in winter (Dec–Jan).  
4. **Weather Conditions** – Rain, Fog, and Snow increase accident risk.  
5. **Hotspot Mapping** – California, Texas, and Florida have the highest accident density.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- 📊 Accidents by Hour  
- 📅 Accidents by Weekday  
- 🌦️ Accidents by Weather Condition  
- 🗺️ Accident Hotspot Map

## 🔑 Key Insights

- Rush hours contribute to most accidents.  
- Bad weather (rain/snow/fog) worsens accident chances.  
- Accidents cluster in urbanized states like **California, Texas, Florida**.

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Kaggle Dataset**
